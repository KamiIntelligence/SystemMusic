SystemMusic
===========

A music player using winmm.dll APIs, meant to be feather light on resources as well as not clog up userspace.
Have any ideas or suggestions? Goahead and tell me them and I will try to implement them!
Please keep your ideas within these guidelines:
SystemMusic is meant to be light on system reasources.
SystemMusic is not meant to be overloaded with features.
SystemMusic is open source, if I do not implement your idea do not feel sad fork this and create what you want!
